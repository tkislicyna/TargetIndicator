"# TargetIndicator" 
The application shows the target indicator
Required design below:

-The application content should be centered on a web page vertically and horizontally
-Get the initial value ($14) from this URL using AJAX
Animation Rules: 
-onLoad, indicator bar grows from position 0 to the initial value
-Increase the value by $0.2 every 2 seconds
-Once the value reaches the target, change the background of the [Target $15] square from gray (as on screenshot) to green (#00A910) and --hide “You need...” text
-The application must be using jQuery.
